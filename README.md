# 💎 EVARA - Personalized Jewelry E-Commerce Platform

<div align="center">

![EVARA Logo](pics/icon.png)

**EVARA** is a small full-stack e-commerce web app I built for a course assignment (1st Year, 2nd Semester). It lets customers browse and customize jewelry, place orders, and lets an admin manage products and orders. I built this to practise connecting a PHP backend to a MySQL database and to explore simple customization tools for product design.
